## Hi, I’m @jovanshernandez
I’m interested in finance, devops, automation, and capital markets.
I’m currently learning python and c++ with a focus on finance, quantitative finance, and algorithmic trading.
I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects that combine my passions.
How to reach me ... you can shoot me an email at jshdevops@gmail.com
