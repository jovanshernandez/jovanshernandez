## Hi, I’m @jovanshernandez
I have a keen interest in the realms of finance, DevOps, automation, and capital markets. My current learning journey is centered around mastering Python and C++, with a specific emphasis on their applications in systems, quantitative finance, and algorithmic trading.

I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on engaging projects that seamlessly weave together my expertise and passion in these domains. If you have exciting initiatives that align with my interests, I'm eager to contribute and be a part of innovative endeavors at the intersection of technology and finance.

How to reach me ... you can shoot me an email at jshdevops@gmail.com
